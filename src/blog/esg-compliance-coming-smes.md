title: "ESG Compliance Is Coming for SMEs — Supply Chain Pressure Makes It Practically Mandatory"

When the EU announced a 90% reduction in CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) requirements for small and medium enterprises, many SME owners took it as a signal that ESG reporting wasn't their problem — at least not yet.

That reading was understandable. It was also wrong.

The regulatory relief that reduced direct ESG reporting obligations for SMEs didn't reduce the practical pressure to report. It shifted where the pressure comes from — from regulators directly to the large enterprises in your supply chain. And for any SME that sells to or serves large companies, the result is nearly the same.

## What the EU Actually Said: 90% Scope Reduction

**The EU reduced direct CSRD requirements for SMEs by approximately 90%** (EU/QIMA, 2025). This was a significant policy adjustment, driven by concerns that the full CSRD compliance burden would be prohibitively expensive for smaller organizations.

Under the revised approach, most SMEs aren't directly required to file comprehensive sustainability reports with regulators. They don't face the same reporting deadlines, disclosure frameworks, or compliance penalties as large enterprises subject to the full CSRD.

This is genuinely good news — the compliance cost avoided is real. But it created a misconception: that ESG compliance is now optional for SMEs. It isn't. The mechanism just changed.

## Voluntary in Name, Required in Practice

To address the ESG information needs that still exist for SMEs — particularly as data sources in large enterprise supply chains — the EU introduced the **Voluntary SME Sustainability Reporting Standard (VSME)** (EU/EFRAG, 2025).

The VSME is designed to be proportionate and lighter-weight than the full CSRD framework. It asks for information appropriate to SME complexity and resources rather than the comprehensive disclosures required of large enterprises.

Here's the critical nuance: while the VSME is technically voluntary from a regulatory standpoint, it isn't voluntary in the business sense. Large enterprises required to report on their supply chain's ESG impact under the full CSRD will require VSME-aligned disclosures from their SME suppliers. Your customer's mandatory reporting obligation becomes your practical requirement.

If your business sells to large enterprises — and many SMEs across the US, Canada, UAE, and Australia do — you'll receive these requests. The VSME framework provides the standard response format.

## FY 2027: When It Becomes Mandatory for the First Wave

**The first mandatory CSRD sustainability reports are due for financial year 2027** (EU CSRD, 2026). That gives businesses less than two years to prepare.

But preparation for FY 2027 reporting doesn't begin in 2027. It requires:

**Baseline establishment**: You need prior-period data to demonstrate trends. A carbon footprint reported for FY 2027 is more credible when you can show FY 2025 and FY 2026 data as comparatives. You can't backfill this — it requires measurement systems operating during those years.

**System implementation**: ESG data collection requires systems — tracking energy consumption, measuring supply chain emissions, documenting governance policies, recording social impact metrics. Building these systems takes 6–12 months depending on complexity.

**Governance documentation**: CSRD-aligned reporting requires documented governance policies, board oversight structures, and risk management frameworks. These need to exist before they can be reported.

**Audit readiness**: Some CSRD disclosures require limited assurance or full audit. The documentation standards that auditors will apply aren't lenient. Starting in 2027 with 2027 data doesn't meet the standard.

## Supply Chain Pressure Is Already Arriving

Large enterprises subject to CSRD aren't waiting for their own reporting deadlines to start engaging their supply chains.

The supply chain data collection process — getting ESG information from hundreds or thousands of suppliers — takes time. Large enterprises are beginning supplier outreach now, building the data infrastructure they'll need for their own mandatory disclosures. This means SMEs in their supply chains are already receiving questionnaires, survey requests, and sustainability data requests.

**If you haven't received an ESG questionnaire from a major customer yet, you may be small enough that it hasn't reached you — or your customer hasn't gotten their own program organized.** Either way, it's coming.

The businesses that have already started tracking relevant metrics — energy consumption, waste generation, social impact data, governance policies — will answer these questionnaires credibly. The businesses that haven't started will scramble to provide data they don't have, or answer with estimates that sophisticated customers will see through.

## What ESG Compliance Actually Requires from SMEs

ESG reporting under the VSME framework is more manageable than full CSRD compliance, but it's not trivial. The key data categories:

**Environmental**: Energy consumption (electricity, natural gas, fuel), carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2 at minimum), waste generation, water use (where material), and any significant environmental impacts of your operations.

**Social**: Employee headcount and turnover data, health and safety incidents, compensation equity data, and community engagement activities.

**Governance**: Board composition and oversight structure, anti-corruption policies, supplier code of conduct, and whistleblower mechanisms.

Much of this data already exists in some form within your business — in HR systems, utility bills, accounting records, and operational data. The challenge is typically that it isn't collected systematically or maintained in a form that's reportable.

## Building ESG Data Infrastructure Now

The most important action for SMEs approaching ESG compliance isn't understanding the framework — it's starting to collect data. The regulatory deadlines and customer requirements will become clearer over time. The data you didn't collect in 2025 and 2026 cannot be recovered.

At Accounting Brains, we support businesses across the US, Canada, UAE, and Australia in building the financial and operational data infrastructure that ESG reporting requires. Our accounting and reporting services create the systematic data collection and documentation foundations that make ESG reporting possible without starting from scratch when requirements crystallize.

ESG compliance isn't a 2027 problem. It's a today problem for the businesses that need 2025 and 2026 baseline data to be credible when they report.
