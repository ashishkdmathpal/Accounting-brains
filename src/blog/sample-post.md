As a small business owner, understanding which expenses you can deduct is crucial for minimizing your tax liability. Many entrepreneurs leave money on the table by overlooking these valuable deductions.

## 1. Home Office Deduction

If you use part of your home exclusively for business, you may be eligible for the home office deduction. This can include a portion of your rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, and maintenance costs.

**Pro tip:** Keep detailed records of your home's square footage and the space used for business to calculate this deduction accurately.

## 2. Vehicle Expenses

Whether you use your vehicle exclusively for business or split usage between personal and business, you can deduct vehicle-related expenses. You have two options:

- **Standard mileage rate**: $0.67 per mile (2024 rate)
- **Actual expenses**: Gas, insurance, repairs, depreciation

## 3. Business Meals

You can deduct 50% of business meal costs when you're discussing business with clients, partners, or employees. Keep detailed records including:

- Date and location
- Business purpose
- Attendees' names

## 4. Professional Development

Courses, conferences, books, and subscriptions that help you maintain or improve skills related to your business are fully deductible.

All business-related software subscriptions are deductible, including:

- Accounting software

- Professional liability (E&O)

## 8. Retirement Contributions

Contributions to SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, or solo 401(k)s are tax-deductible and help you save for the future while reducing current tax liability.
