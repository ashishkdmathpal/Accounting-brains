On December 29th last year, a retired executive called our office in a panic.

She'd sold her business earlier in the year for a significant gain. Her accountant had just delivered the news: she owed $340,000 in federal taxes. Was there anything she could do?

"You're passionate about education," I asked. "Have you considered a donor-advised fund?"

By December 31st, she had contributed $500,000 in appreciated stock to a donor-advised fund. The result: a $185,000 reduction in her tax bill, zero capital gains tax on the stock appreciation, and a charitable fund she could distribute to schools over the next decade.

**She still had the same charitable intent she'd always had. She just executed it strategically.**

If you're looking to maximize your charitable impact while optimizing your tax situation before December 31st, this guide is for you.

## The Charitable Deduction Basics

Before diving into strategies, let's review how charitable deductions work in 2025:

**Itemizing requirement:** You must itemize deductions to claim charitable contributions. With the standard deduction at $14,600 (single) or $29,200 (married filing jointly), you need significant deductions to benefit.

**AGI limitations:**
- Cash contributions: Up to 60% of adjusted gross income (AGI)
- Appreciated property: Up to 30% of AGI
- Private foundations: Up to 30% of AGI (20% for appreciated property)

**Carryforward:** Contributions exceeding AGI limits can be carried forward for up to five years.

**Substantiation requirements:**
- Under $250: Cancelled check, receipt, or reliable written record
- $250+: Written acknowledgment from the charity before filing
- $500+: Form 8283 required for non-cash contributions
- $5,000+: Qualified appraisal required for non-cash contributions (except publicly traded securities)

## Strategy #1: Bunching Contributions

If your annual giving doesn't push you over the standard deduction threshold, consider "bunching" multiple years of giving into one year.

**How it works:**

Instead of giving $15,000 annually (which, combined with other deductions, might not exceed the standard deduction), give $45,000 in one year and nothing for the next two.

**Example:**
- Married couple with $10,000 in state/local taxes and $15,000 in annual giving
- Total itemized deductions: $25,000
- Standard deduction: $29,200
- Without bunching: Take standard deduction every year, get no tax benefit from giving

**With bunching (every third year):**
- Year 1: $10,000 SALT + $45,000 contributions = $55,000 itemized deductions
- Years 2-3: Take standard deduction

Result: $25,800 in additional deductions over the standard deduction, worth $6,450+ in tax savings (at 25% bracket).

## Strategy #2: Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)

A donor-advised fund is like a charitable savings account. You contribute now (and take the deduction now), but distribute to charities over time.

**Benefits:**
- Immediate tax deduction in high-income years
- Time to research and select recipient charities
- Simplified recordkeeping (one acknowledgment for the DAF contribution)
- Can contribute appreciated assets (avoiding capital gains)
- Assets grow tax-free until distributed

**Perfect for:**
- Business owners with a liquidity event
- Executives receiving large bonuses
- Anyone wanting to "pre-fund" future giving
- Those who want the deduction now but need time to decide which charities to support

**Important notes:**
- Contributions are irrevocable (you can't get the money back)
- Grants must go to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations
- You advise on distributions, but the DAF sponsor has final say (though recommendations are almost always followed)
- Minimum contribution amounts vary by sponsor ($5,000-$25,000 typically)

## Strategy #3: Appreciated Stock Donations

Donating appreciated securities directly to charity (or a DAF) provides a double tax benefit:

1. **Deduction** for full fair market value
2. **No capital gains tax** on the appreciation

**Example:**
You purchased stock for $20,000 that's now worth $50,000.

**Option A - Sell and donate cash:**
- Sell stock: $30,000 gain × 23.8% tax = $7,140 in taxes
- Donate $42,860 after-tax proceeds
- Deduction: $42,860

**Option B - Donate stock directly:**
- No capital gains tax
- Donate full $50,000 in value
- Deduction: $50,000

Donating the stock directly provides $7,140 more to charity AND $7,140 higher deduction—a win-win-win.

**Requirements:**
- Stock must be held more than one year (for full fair market value deduction)
- Must be publicly traded (private stock has different rules)
- Charity must be able to receive stock (most large organizations can)

## Strategy #4: Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)

If you're 70½ or older, you can donate up to $105,000 directly from your IRA to charity. This is called a Qualified Charitable Distribution.

**Benefits:**
- Counts toward your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)
- Excluded from taxable income entirely
- Works even if you take the standard deduction
- Reduces AGI (which can reduce Medicare premiums, Social Security taxation, etc.)

**Example:**
You have a $100,000 RMD and typically give $20,000 to charity.

**Without QCD:**
- Take $100,000 RMD (fully taxable)
- Donate $20,000 (deduction only if itemizing)

**With QCD:**
- Transfer $20,000 directly from IRA to charity (not taxable)
- Take $80,000 RMD (taxable)
- Result: $20,000 less in taxable income, regardless of itemizing

**Requirements:**
- Must be 70½ or older
- Funds must go directly from IRA to charity (not to you first)
- Must be a qualified charity (not a DAF or private foundation)
- Must get proper acknowledgment

## Strategy #5: Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)

For those with significant appreciated assets seeking income, charitable remainder trusts offer unique benefits.

**How it works:**
1. Transfer appreciated assets to an irrevocable trust
2. Receive annual income payments (typically 5-8% of trust value)
3. Remaining assets go to charity at trust termination (or your death)

**Benefits:**
- Immediate partial charitable deduction
- Bypass capital gains on appreciated assets
- Receive income stream for life (or a term of years)
- Diversify concentrated positions without triggering gains

**Best for:**
- Those with highly appreciated assets seeking income
- Planned giving as part of estate planning
- Those who want to support charity but also need cash flow

**Considerations:**
- Legal and administrative costs to establish
- Irrevocable—you can't get the principal back
- Complex tax rules—professional guidance essential
- Minimum 10% remainder value requirement

## Last-Minute Giving Checklist

With December 31st approaching, here's what you can still accomplish:

**By December 31st:**

- [ ] Credit card donations (date of charge counts, not payment)
- [ ] Check donations (postmarked by 12/31)
- [ ] Stock transfers (initiated by 12/28 for safe processing)
- [ ] DAF contributions (check sponsor deadlines—some cut off early)
- [ ] QCDs from IRAs (custodian processing time varies)

**Documentation needed:**

- [ ] Written acknowledgment for donations $250+
- [ ] Description and valuation for non-cash items
- [ ] Basis documentation for appreciated property
- [ ] Form 8283 for non-cash donations over $500

## What Doesn't Qualify

Don't assume every "donation" counts:

**Not deductible:**
- Contributions to individuals (including GoFundMe for a person)
- Political contributions
- Raffle tickets, lottery tickets, or gambling proceeds
- Value of your time or services
- "Donations" where you receive equivalent value (that's a purchase)

**Partially deductible:**
- Charity event tickets: Only the amount exceeding fair market value
- Charity auctions: Only the amount exceeding item value

## Planning for 2026

While you're maximizing 2025 deductions, start thinking about next year:

**Consider:**
- Setting up a DAF for flexibility
- Reviewing estate plans for charitable provisions
- Establishing a giving budget aligned with tax planning
- Identifying appreciated securities for future donations
- Coordinating with your CPA on overall tax strategy

**For non-profit leaders:**
Your donors are thinking about these strategies right now. Make it easy for them to give appreciated stock. Mention QCDs to older donors. Provide year-end acknowledgments promptly.

## The Bottom Line

Strategic charitable giving isn't about gaming the system—it's about maximizing your impact. Every dollar saved in taxes through smart planning is a dollar that can go to causes you care about (either to the same charity or others).

The executive who opened this article? She's now a board member at a local education foundation. Her donor-advised fund has distributed over $200,000 to schools across her region. And she tells everyone who will listen: "My CPA showed me how to give more, not less. I just had to do it strategically."
