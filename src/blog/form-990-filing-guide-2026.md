Three years ago, a small environmental non-profit in Oregon stopped filing their Form 990. They didn't mean to—they'd lost their bookkeeper, the new executive director didn't know it was required, and the IRS letters went to an old address.

On the third anniversary of their last filing, they received a certified letter: **automatic revocation of tax-exempt status.**

Overnight, donations became non-deductible for their donors. Their major funder pulled a $200,000 grant. It took them 18 months and $15,000 in legal and accounting fees to reinstate their status.

**The Form 990 isn't just paperwork. It's the lifeline of your tax-exempt status.**

If you're responsible for your organization's 990 filing in 2026, this guide will help you navigate the process—and avoid becoming another cautionary tale.

## Understanding Which Form 990 You Need

Not all 990s are created equal. The form you file depends on your organization's size:

| Form | Gross Receipts | Total Assets | Filing Requirement |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **990-N (e-Postcard)** | ≤ $50,000 | Any | Electronic only, 8 questions |
| **990-EZ** | < $200,000 | < $500,000 | Short form, basic schedules |
| **990** | ≥ $200,000 OR | ≥ $500,000 | Full form, all applicable schedules |
| **990-PF** | Any | Any | Private foundations only |

*Important: These thresholds are based on your organization's normal levels, not a single unusual year.*

## Critical Deadlines for 2026

For calendar-year filers (January 1 - December 31, 2025):

- **May 15, 2026**: Original filing deadline (5½ months after fiscal year end)
- **August 15, 2026**: Extended deadline (with Form 8868)
- **November 15, 2026**: Final extended deadline (second extension)

**Mark these dates now.** Missing the deadline—even with extensions filed—triggers penalties of $20 per day, up to the lesser of $10,500 or 5% of gross receipts.

For organizations with gross receipts over $1 million, the penalty increases to $105 per day, up to $53,000.

## The 7 Most Common Form 990 Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

After reviewing hundreds of 990s, we've identified the errors that cause the most problems:

### Mistake #1: Inconsistent Revenue Reporting

Your Part VIII (Statement of Revenue) should reconcile with your audited financial statements. When it doesn't, it triggers IRS questions and erodes donor confidence.

**Solution:** Prepare a reconciliation worksheet that bridges your financial statement revenue to your 990 revenue. Document all differences (timing, presentation, GAAP vs. tax basis).

### Mistake #2: Incorrect Compensation Reporting

Part VII requires disclosure of compensation for officers, directors, and key employees. Common errors include:
- Excluding reportable compensation from related organizations
- Miscalculating "other compensation" (retirement contributions, health insurance)
- Failing to report former officers who received compensation

**Solution:** Create a compensation worksheet by December 31st that captures all forms of compensation for each reportable individual.

### Mistake #3: Missing or Incorrect Schedule B

Schedule B (Schedule of Contributors) requires disclosure of donors who gave more than $5,000 or 2% of total contributions (whichever is greater). This schedule is not public, but errors here can trigger audit flags.

**Solution:** Run a donor report sorted by total annual giving before preparing Schedule B. Verify that contributor totals match Part VIII Line 1.

### Mistake #4: Incomplete Governance Disclosures

Part VI asks detailed questions about your governance practices. "No" answers to certain questions—like whether you have a conflict of interest policy—can raise red flags for funders and watchdog organizations.

**Solution:** Review Part VI questions with your board before filing season. Use any "no" answers as a roadmap for governance improvements.

### Mistake #5: Functional Expense Allocation Errors

The functional expense statement (Part IX) must allocate expenses across program services, management, and fundraising. Arbitrary allocations—or allocations that don't match your audited financials—create problems.

**Solution:** Document your allocation methodology. Common methods include time studies, square footage, and direct assignment. Whatever method you use, apply it consistently.

### Mistake #6: Incomplete Program Service Descriptions

Part III asks you to describe your three largest programs by expense. Vague descriptions like "provided services to the community" don't satisfy IRS requirements—or impress potential donors reviewing your 990.

**Solution:** Quantify your impact. Instead of "provided youth services," write "delivered after-school tutoring to 347 students across 12 schools, resulting in average grade improvement of 1.2 points."

### Mistake #7: Failing to Report Related Organizations

If your non-profit controls or is controlled by another organization, Schedule R is required. Missing this disclosure is a common—and serious—oversight.

**Solution:** Map your organizational structure. Consider parent organizations, subsidiaries, supporting organizations, and disregarded entities.

## The Schedule Maze: Which Ones Do You Need?

Form 990 includes 16 possible schedules. Here's when each applies:

| Schedule | When Required |
|----------|---------------|
| A | Public charity status (almost all 501(c)(3)s) |
| B | Contributors over $5,000 |
| C | Political campaign or lobbying activities |
| D | Donor-advised funds, art, endowments, etc. |
| F | Activities outside the United States |
| G | Gaming or fundraising events |
| I | Grants to organizations |
| J | Compensation over $150,000 |
| L | Transactions with interested persons |
| M | Non-cash contributions over $25,000 |
| O | Supplemental information |
| R | Related organizations |

Most organizations file at least Schedules A, B, D, and O. Your specific activities determine the rest.

## Building Your 990 Preparation Timeline

A well-organized approach prevents last-minute chaos:

**January-February:**
- Close books for the prior year
- Complete audit (if applicable)
- Gather compensation data

**March:**
- Draft Form 990 with all schedules
- Prepare reconciliations to financial statements
- Identify any governance or policy updates needed

**April:**
- Management review of draft
- Board review (if your policy requires it)
- Final corrections and sign-off

**By May 15:**
- E-file the return
- Maintain confirmation of filing
- Post public copy to your website (best practice)

## When to Consider Professional Help

Preparing a Form 990 internally is possible, but consider professional assistance if:

- Your organization has gross receipts over $500,000
- You're filing the full Form 990 (not 990-N or 990-EZ)
- You have complex restricted funds or grants
- You've experienced significant changes (leadership, programs, structure)
- You've received IRS correspondence about prior returns
- Your board or funders require CPA-prepared returns

The cost of professional preparation is often less than the cost of a single penalty—and significantly less than the cost of revocation.

## The Real Purpose of Form 990

Beyond compliance, your Form 990 is a public document that tells your organization's story. Donors, foundations, journalists, and watchdog organizations will read it.

A well-prepared 990 demonstrates:
- Strong governance and transparency
- Efficient use of donor funds
- Meaningful program impact
- Professional financial management

A poorly prepared 990 raises questions you don't want asked.

## Moving Forward with Confidence

The Oregon non-profit we mentioned at the start eventually recovered. They're now thriving, with stronger financial systems and a board that understands the importance of compliance.

But they'll tell you: the pain of revocation was avoidable. The warning signs were there. They just didn't know what to look for.

**Don't wait for a certified letter to take your Form 990 seriously.** With proper preparation, timely filing, and attention to detail, your 990 can be a straightforward annual milestone rather than a source of anxiety.
