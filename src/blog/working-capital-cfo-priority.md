Every year, finance leaders are asked to rank their priorities. The answers shift with economic cycles, technology trends, and regulatory changes. But 2025 produced a clear consensus at the top of the list that should concern every business operating without dedicated financial leadership.

Working capital management — the discipline of optimizing cash flow, receivables, payables, and liquidity — ranked as the **#1 finance priority for CFOs in 2025** (Hackett Group, 2025).

Not revenue growth. Not technology investment. Not cost reduction. Cash flow. The most fundamental metric of business health topped the list.

## Why Cash Flow Beats Everything Else

The ranking reflects what experienced CFOs have known for years but that many growing businesses discover too late: without working capital management, no other financial strategy matters.

You can have a strong product, a growing customer base, and a profitable P&L — and still face existential cash flow problems. Revenue on paper doesn't pay payroll. Accounts receivable outstanding doesn't fund vendor payments. The timing gap between cash out and cash in is where businesses fail.

**82% of small business failures trace back to cash flow problems** (U.S. Bank Small Business Survey). Not competition. Not bad products. The inability to manage the timing and visibility of cash.

When CFOs rank working capital as their top priority, they're reflecting hard-earned wisdom about what actually determines business survival.

## 47% Have Real-Time Visibility — The Other 53% Are Flying Blind

The technology for cash flow visibility has advanced considerably.

**47% of SMEs now use bank-integrated tools for cash visibility** (JP Morgan/Celonis, 2025) — real-time balance visibility, automated forecasting, instant reconciliation. These businesses know their cash position not at month-end, not at week-end, but continuously.

The other 53% depend on bank statements, manual reconciliation, and periodic reporting that's always days behind reality. They're making cash management decisions based on data that's inherently stale.

In a business environment where payment timing, vendor terms, and customer behavior can shift cash position by hundreds of thousands of dollars within a week, operating without real-time visibility is managing blind. The decisions made on stale data cost money — in late payments, missed discount opportunities, unnecessary line-of-credit draws, and strategic decisions made without accurate cash context.

## The Strongest Predictor of SME Profitability

Working capital management's importance is now quantified in academic research.

**A working capital management score correlates with SME profitability at R²=0.93** (Academic Research, 2025). For context, an R² of 1.0 would be a perfect correlation. At 0.93, working capital management is the single strongest predictor of SME profitability that researchers have identified — stronger than revenue growth rate, market position, or any other commonly tracked metric.

This is why CFOs obsess over it. It's not financial theory. It's the variable that most directly determines whether a business makes money.

## The Cash Conversion Cycle: Your Real Scorecard

Three metrics tell more about business health than any P&L:

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: How long it takes your customers to pay after invoicing. Every extra day your receivables sit uncollected is a day you're financing your customers' operations.

**Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)**: How long you take to pay vendors. Extending this appropriately — without damaging vendor relationships — preserves cash without borrowing.

**Inventory Turns** (where applicable): How efficiently inventory converts to sales and cash. Slow-moving inventory is capital trapped in the wrong form.

The Cash Conversion Cycle — the combination of these three metrics — is the scoreboard that sophisticated finance teams use to measure working capital performance. Improving it by even a few days can release significant amounts of trapped cash, often more than a comparable revenue increase would generate.

## Q1 Just Closed — Do You Know Your Cash Position?

Quarter-end is the natural moment to assess working capital health. How quickly after March 31 did you have accurate, complete information about your cash position?

The businesses with CFO-level financial oversight have this information within 24 hours of quarter-end. They know their DSO trend. They know their payables position. They know their net working capital and how it compares to the previous quarter.

The businesses without that oversight are still assembling the picture days or weeks later — making planning decisions for Q2 based on incomplete Q1 data.

## Building CFO-Level Cash Flow Infrastructure

The businesses that win the working capital game aren't necessarily the ones with the best products or the most customers. They're the ones that built the financial infrastructure to see clearly and act quickly.

That infrastructure has several components:

**Real-time bank integration**: Knowing your cash position as of today, not as of the last reconciliation.

**Accounts receivable discipline**: Systematic follow-up on overdue receivables, early payment incentives, and DSO tracking.

**Payables optimization**: Strategic management of payment timing to maximize float without damaging vendor relationships.

**90-day cash forecasting**: Projecting cash flows forward based on known commitments and realistic revenue assumptions.

At Accounting Brains, we provide the operational finance backbone that makes CFO-level working capital management possible for businesses across the US, Canada, UAE, and Australia. Our teams manage AP/AR with visibility into payment timing, maintain current reconciliations that reflect real-time cash position, and support the reporting infrastructure that fractional CFOs rely on to make informed decisions.

Working capital is the #1 CFO priority because it's the #1 determinant of business health. Building the infrastructure to manage it well is how growing businesses stay growing.
